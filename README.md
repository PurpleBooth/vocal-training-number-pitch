This is a simple static web page to help me practice using variance in pitch in my voice.

What it does
============

Outputs the numbers 1-10 with a an arrow indicating if I should step my pitch up or down.

The pitch will change randomly, but never more than 3 in any single direction (so UP-UP-UP will gurantee a down next).

It's deployed at [https://number-pitch.appspot.com](https://number-pitch.appspot.com)
